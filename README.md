# Android-Basic-Gallery

Android Basic Galler is a simple but functional photo gallery that uses a Cursor Loader to with an AsycTask to load images and a Cursor Adapter to display the images in a GridView.

I have also added an LRU cache to this implementation to help minimise re-loading of images close to the scroll point.
